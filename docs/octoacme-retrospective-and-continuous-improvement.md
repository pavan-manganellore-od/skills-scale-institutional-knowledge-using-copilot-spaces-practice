# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Owner:
- Due date:
- Success criteria:

## Sprint Retrospective Template

Use this template to structure your retrospective discussions:

### 1. Set the Stage (5 min)
- Review retrospective goals and ground rules

**What Could Be Improved** (Stop or change)
- Example: "Requirements were unclear, causing rework"
- Example: "Too many context switches affected developer focus"

**Appreciations** (Optional but encouraged)
- Recognize specific contributions and helpful behaviors

### 3. Generate Insights (10 min)
- Group similar themes
- Identify root causes (use "5 Whys" technique if helpful)
- Discuss patterns or recurring issues

### 4. Decide What to Do (15 min)
- Brainstorm potential actions
- Prioritize 2-3 actionable improvements
- Assign clear owners and due dates
- Define success criteria for each action

### 5. Close (5 min)
