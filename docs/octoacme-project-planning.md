# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Establish design review and approval process (UX/UI Designer)
8. Confirm architectural approach and technical standards (Solution Architect)
9. Validate business requirements completeness (Business Analyst)

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Definition of Done (DoD) Template

A clear Definition of Done ensures consistent quality standards. Customize based on project needs:

### Code Level
- [ ] Code implements all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (target: >80% coverage)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by at least one peer
- [ ] No critical or high-severity security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Code follows team style guide and linting rules
- [ ] Technical documentation updated (architecture decisions, API docs)

### Feature Level
- [ ] Integration tests pass for critical user flows
- [ ] Acceptance criteria validated by Business Analyst
- [ ] Design implementation reviewed by UX/UI Designer
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (e.g., page load < 3s)
- [ ] User-facing documentation or help text added

### Release Level
- [ ] All feature-level DoD items completed
- [ ] End-to-end smoke tests pass in staging environment
- [ ] Security scanning completed (Solution Architect sign-off)
- [ ] Release notes drafted and approved
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] Stakeholder demo completed and approved
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured for new features

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs

## Planning Checklist
- [ ] Project kickoff held
- [ ] Backlog prioritized and estimated
- [ ] Release timeline and milestones agreed
- [ ] Definition of Done documented
- [ ] Initial test plan / QA approach drafted
- [ ] Design system and components identified (UX/UI Designer)
- [ ] Architecture review completed (Solution Architect)
- [ ] Business requirements validated (Business Analyst)
- [ ] Sprint/Iteration cadence and ceremonies scheduled (Scrum Master)
- [ ] Cross-functional handoff points clarified
