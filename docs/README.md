# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how OctoAcme runs projects, ensuring consistent delivery practices, clear ownership, and continuous improvement across all teams.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery. Our methodology emphasizes small, testable increments, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety that encourages feedback and learning.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to maximize learning and reduce risk
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless retrospectives

### Key Roles

OctoAcme projects involve several key roles working together:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs and approvals

### Major Process Phases

OctoAcme projects follow a structured lifecycle with five major phases:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks, align timelines
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate with regular demos and quality checks
4. **Release**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and announce to stakeholders
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements
